# Expo Camera Preview Rendering Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug related to the rendering of the Expo Camera component when used in conjunction with dynamic UI updates or state management libraries. The camera preview may fail to appear correctly, freeze, or display unexpected behavior due to asynchronous operations and React's reconciliation process.

## Problem Description

The `Camera` component's preview might not update correctly when the surrounding layout changes, often leading to a broken or missing preview.  This issue is amplified when using libraries like Redux, Zustand, or Context API, particularly with frequent state changes.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Run the app using `expo start`
4. Observe the camera preview's behavior, especially when interacting with UI elements that trigger re-renders.

## Solution

The solution involves strategically managing the component's lifecycle and rendering process, ensuring the camera preview updates correctly without interference from layout changes.  This often involves careful use of state updates, component mounting/unmounting, and optimization of UI updates.
